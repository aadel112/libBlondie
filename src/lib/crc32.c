itself is calculated, if it has not yet been set up.
Not counting the table setup (which would probably be a separate
function), when compiled to Cyclops with GCC, this function executes in
7 + 13n instructions, where n is the number of bytes in the input
message. It should be doable in 4 + 9n instructions. In any case, two
of the 13 or 9 instrucions are load byte.
